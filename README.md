Just a bunch of scripts that can be used in talks, papers, posters, ...

## Gradient Descent Animation (with LaTeX export)
This project presents some animations of
[gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).
You can choose whether you just want to see the animation or exporting a GIF or even saving a tikz plot 
ready to be included in your LaTeX documents.

Check the [README](./grad_descend_animation/README.md) for additional details.
